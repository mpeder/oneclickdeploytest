## What is Google Cloud Cortex Framework for Meridian?

One of the key value propositions of Google Cloud Cortex Framework is to provide a Data & AI foundation for next generation enterprise intelligence that enables analytics spanning across key areas such as sales and marketing, order fulfillment and inventory management. 

Cortex for Marketing provides cross media platform KPIs and metrics. These metrics are a significant part of the pre-modeling data preparation step for running Googleâ€™s latest Marketing Mix Model (MMM) called Meridian. Advertisers can accelerate the pre-modeling data preparation process by leveraging Cortex Data Foundation.
